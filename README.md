## Project Brief
We were given one week to create an Express.js app using Node.js and MongoDB. This project helped us to understand server side architecture, the MVC model and user authentication by way of sessions. We had the choice of three types of app, I chose the instagram clone as I thought it would would give me a lot of opportunity to better understand embedded and referenced data.

## Design Phase
This project threw a lot of new technologies and ideas our way so to keep the wire-framing relatively quick and easy I drew a lot of my design and user journey inspiration from Instagram itself.

The home page is much like Instagram's in that it asks the user to login or register from here:

The explore page is also very similar to Instagram's in that it shows all user's images on the site and displays any likes they have received. You can also click on any image to see more information about the post and the user who uploaded it:

## Wins
This was a very challenging project for me since it was our first introduction to backend development. When we were first exposed to embedded and referenced data in the database I found it quite confusing but I quickly got to grips with them. By the end of the project I was very comfortable adding new features that would rely on these concepts.  

## Blockers
This was also the first time I attempted to use a third party API, namely Filestack to let user's upload their images. Though it took some time to get it working reading the documentation and reaching out to their support team was good practice for future API use.

## Instructions
- Clone or download the repo
- Install dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Start the local MongoDB server in Node.js with `mongod`
- Launch the app with `node index`
