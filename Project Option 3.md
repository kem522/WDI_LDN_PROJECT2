# PROJECT 2: OPTION 3 - Instagram Clone

***

You should create a clone of Instagram that meets the following minimum criteria: 

## MVP

* Has a User model and user authentication.
* Has Photo and Comment models.
* Allow users to create, edit and delete posts and comments.
* Lets users 'like' photos.
* Is styled with Bulma, but doesn't look like Bulma.

## Extras

* Allows users to upload images with Filestack.
* Let users 'follow' other users, and only display posts from those users on the main feed (will still need an 'explore' option).
* Any other features you want!

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.
* **Incude relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
* **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
* Have **semantically clean HTML** - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Tips

* Use your notes in the GitBook.
* Check out the [CheeseBored] (https://cheesebored.herokuapp.com/) app, which is an authenticated RESTful app.
